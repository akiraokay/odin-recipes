    <ul>
      <li>5 eggs</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat all ingredients together in a bowl</li>
      <li>
        Using a ladel, pour a small amount of the mixture into the square pan,
        enough for a layer a few millimetres thick to form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before the mixture cooks through, slide it to the far end of the pan,
        then place another ladel of mixture in the newly created space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before the new layer cooks through, roll the old block of egg over
        itself and into the new layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide the new, bigger block to the far edge of the pan, and repeat until
        you have used all the egg.
      </li>
    </ol>
